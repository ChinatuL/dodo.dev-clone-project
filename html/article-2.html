                            In 2019, I wanted to create a website that closely
                            followed our custom design and had smooth animations
                            and interactions. I looked at
                            <a
                                href="https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction"
                                class="article-link"
                                >UIkit,</a
                            >
                            but I didn't pick it for two reasons:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="article-list">
                            <li>It had its own opinion on design</li>
                            <li>
                                It didn't meet my requirements for "smoothness"
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This lead me to search for other frameworks that,
                            unlike UIkit, provide just the basic JavaScript
                            functionality, allowing you to style and animate as
                            you wish. I didn't find anything. So, naturally, I
                            decided to make
                            <a
                                href="https://github.com/OblikStudio/toolkit"
                                target="_blank"
                                class="article-link"
                                >my own thing.</a
                            >
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was developing the framework in parallel with the
                            website I was working on and it was wonderful. I was
                            able to make the code just right and implement just
                            the features I need. I took some inspiration from
                            UIkit, but stuck to my main idea.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Later, I noticed that things weren't very efficient,
                            so I decided to refactor. But because I was
                            developing that framework and simultaneously using
                            it, I had to rework not only the framework, but the
                            website as well. Apart from that, I was trying to
                            make this work for as many use cases as I could.
                            What if you use React? What if you don't? What if
                            you use jQuery? What if you don't even know
                            JavaScript that much?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this point, my enthusiasm slowly started to fade
                            away. Without realizing it, I had put myself in a
                            position where I wanted to solve problems that don't
                            yet exist and solve them perfectly. But I still
                            believed that in the end, it'd be "worth it".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, our team started to grow. I was no longer the
                            only one working on that website. Since it used my
                            framework, I had to onboard new people with it. This
                            meant that I had to write up a README, then
                            documentation, example usage, etc. Despite that, we
                            still had to clear up some stuff in Slack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because our team grew, so did our workload. This
                            caused work on the framework in parallel with the
                            website to transition in work on the framework
                            during the weekends and early mornings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I carried on, though. I had (and to this point,
                            still have) the habit of abandoning projects, so I
                            was determined to at least boil the framework down
                            to small organized JavaScript snippets that you
                            could download via npm. But do I use
                            <a
                                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements"
                                target="_blank"
                                class="article-link"
                                >Custom Elements</a
                            >
                            or even go simpler than that and use just ES6
                            classes?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recently, I started getting more and more into the
                            React ecosystem. Late to the party, I know. I also
                            started noticing more websites with
                            <code>&lt;div id="__next"&gt;</code> or
                            <code>__nuxt</code> or <code>___gatsby</code>. So no
                            matter how I build my framework, it wouldn't work
                            with the way most people build for the web. Since I
                            want to start using these tools as well, my
                            framework won't work for me either.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unrelated to this, I had slowly started to pay more
                            attention to my health and well-being. I changed my
                            eating and sleeping habits, started to exercise and
                            stretch more, I even started reading booksâ€¦ This
                            made the weekends and early mornings much more
                            packed and valuable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And now I'm here. I had made something that nobody
                            really uses, but still represents a solid part of
                            our workflow. What do I do? Well, I think I've
                            learned some lessons in the past 3 years.

                            Unless you're building software for aircraft or
                            medical equipment, nobody really cares about your
                            code, and neither should you. Especially in web
                            development. At the end of the day, you want a bunch
                            of boxes with text and images in them. You can have
                            a hellish codebase and still get the job done. A
                            perfect codebase doesn't exist. At least not for a
                            very long time, in large projects, or with many
                            people involved. Things will get messy and you
                            should be ready to accept that.

                            new people will join and documentation will be

                            maintaining something yourself, they won't matter.
                            If that third-party code has been out for a long

                            time on solved problems.

                        <p>
                            I never really launched my side project. It wasn't
                            "ready". At the same time, it became a bigger and
                            bigger dependency in our main projects. That's an
                            issue, because you're building on top of something
                            that isn't validated by other people. If I had
                            shared it, maybe people would have helped out and
                            given ideas for improvements. Or, maybe people would
                            have critiqued it and made me question whether it's
                            valuable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And that's what I was most afraid of â€” that the
                            project isn't valuable. But no matter how much
                            effort you put into something, you still can't know
                            for sure if it's valuable until other people give
                            their own points of view. That's why it's better to
                            launch as soon as possible:

                                If you've built something valuable, you'll get
                                more like-minded people to help you out with it
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you've built something pointless, you'll save
                                time and probably learn about new and better
                                approaches

                            I will archive my project. These problems have
                            already been solved by many people, many times. We
                            all know that

                            got the silver bullet and can solve a certain
                            problem once and for all. But that's impossible and
                            delusional. It's like that

                            We should work on solving new problems, not existing
                            ones. If you find an issue with someone else's code,
                            report it or directly submit a pull request and fix
                            it. Not just for yourself, but for everybody else!
                            Your contributions will be nicely welcomed! Don't
                            create something new with its own set of problems.

                            It's impossible to build something entirely by
                            yourself. At some point, your "pristine" code will
                            have to interact with other people's "messy" code.
                            Sure, you might not use third-party code on your
                            website, but its existence still depends on it. The
                            operating system it runs on is not built by you. The
                            browser that your viewers use to see it is not built
                            by you. The protocols that carry your data across
                            the wire are not designed by you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will always depend on other people's work.
                            Embrace that!
