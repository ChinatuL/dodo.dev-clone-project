                        I was working on a PHP site that suddenly started

                            causing timeouts. However, this didn't make much
                            sense because as it can bee seen on the screenshot
                            above, the throughput utilization had barely reached
                            ~25% at its peak.

                            Crossing off throughput as the issue, I wanted to
                            see what was causing the unexpected spikes in EFS.
                            Maybe there was a way to get something like a log
                            file with all reads and writes to the filesystem,
                            similar to the access.log file that nginx outputs. I

                            for reading and writing files.

                            It turned out that we were reading about
                            <strong>20 megabytes</strong> of data on
                            <strong>each request</strong>. This was obviously
                            very stupid and inefficient, but also extremely
                            slow. Before the breaking update, we were reading
                            around 5MB on each request, which was still a lot,
                            but apparently not high enough to cause an issue.

                            time, we didn't go beyond any limits.

                            getting around 2.5 seconds response time, while
                            receiving about 2 requests per second. We were load
                            balancing two servers, so each one was handling about 1
                            request per second. This meant:

                            response is served, 2.5 new requests have come in. PHP
                            responds to that by spawning more processes to handle
                            the overwhelming load, until it reaches the maximum
                            allowed processes, which in my case was 50. After that,
                            it just refuses to accept any more requests and that's
                            when the errors start.

                            everything was going great. It had no reason to spawn
                            any more servers, because our scaling metric was CPU
                            utilization, and there was not a single threshold
                            crossed. CPU load was indeed higher than usual, but not
                            enough to be treated as a breach. The

                            setting was preventing that from happening, because PHP
                            couldn't spawn enough processes to get the CPUs hot
                            enough.

                            the hopes of fixing the problem. It worked out, for
                            reasons I've already explained. But after a while, the
                            errors started popping up again, so we rolled back the

                            around 0.5, so we removed the extra servers and
                            everything was back to normal.

                            Bottlenecks are a lot harder to debug, compared to
                            regular errors, because the code actually works and
                            behaves as expected. They're harder to come across
                            locally or on a staging server, because it's the load
                            that's causing the problem, not the logic.
