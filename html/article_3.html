                                    browsing, they'll be downloading the

                                While browser caching helps with many requests
                                by the same user, it doesn't solve the issue of
                                many users making requests, because each user
                                has their own browser with their own cache. To
                                fix this, you need a shared cache.
                            </p>

                                With a CDN, all user requests are funneled
                                through the closest edge server. If that server
                                caches the responses, it'll be able to serve
                                those users without having to bother your own
                                server. This means that it no longer matters if
                                you have 1 user or 10000, because once that
                                first response for a resource is served and
                                cached, the load shifts from your server to the
                                CDN, which can serve the other 9999 by itself.

                                cart, and if you cache that, the next user will
                                see the previous one's items. On the other hand,
                                an image is expected to be the same for every
                                user and can safely be cached.

                                contact your server, as long as everything is
                                cached. This way, you can have a very weak

                                second, because the load is mainly on the CDN..
